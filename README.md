# project-sagemaker-for-sentiment-analysis
In this project i have constructed a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. I have created this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, I have deployed this model and constructed a simple web app which will interact with my deployed model.
