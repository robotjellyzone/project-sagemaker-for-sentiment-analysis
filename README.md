# project-sagemaker-for-sentiment-analysis
In this project i have constructed a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. I have created this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, I have deployed this model and constructed a simple web app which will interact with my deployed model.

In the deployed web app will take the review of movie from the user and will predict whether the review was **POSITIVE** or **NEGATIVE** 

### Web App Screenshot :-
